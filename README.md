# Project : Navbar and Scroll

## Overview
This project is a **responsive web page** that combines a **fixed navigation bar** with smooth **scrolling navigation**. It includes two major components :
1. Navbar with Responsive Design
2. Smooth Scrolling Sections
This project is designed to be simple yet modern, making it easier for users to navigate through different sections of the website without page reloads.

## Features
### 1. Navbar (Module 04)
#### 1. Responsive Navbar :
   - The navbar switches between a horizontal layout for desktop views and a hamburger menu for mobile views.
   - The navigation items include: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
#### 2. Social Media Icons :
   - Added Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram icons using Font Awesome for consistent styling.
   - The icons are designed to open the respective social media pages in a new tab.
#### 3. Fixed Navbar :
   - The navbar remains fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it is always accessible, even when the user scrolls down.
### 2. Scroll Section (Module 10)
#### 1. Smooth Scrolling :
     - The page supports smooth scrolling, which makes the transition from one section to another more fluid.
     - Links like Home, About, Services, and Contact scroll smoothly to their respective sections.
#### 2. Sticky Navbar :
     - The navigation bar becomes sticky at the top of the page while scrolling, ensuring it remains in view at all times.
#### 3. Section Layout :
     - **Home :** The initial screen with a banner and introduction.
     - **About :** A section to introduce the project or business.
     - **Services :** A section to describe the services offered.
     - **Contact :** A section with social media links and contact options.
#### 4. Back to Top Button:
     - A floating button that allows users to quickly scroll back to the top of the page.
